# Game Time

## Synopsis

This project is a new take on the classic Frogger game, and is called Soot Sprint. It takes thematic content from Studio Ghibli's animated film Spirited Away. The application was developed in order to practice using canvas and developing unit testing.  This project was developed for a class at the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Usage
On page load, the user sees the start page, and can click the play button to start the game.  The soot is set to the bottom of the canvas and the user must maneuver the soot sprite up to the fires at the top of the canvas, using the up, left, right, and down keys, whilst trying to avoid the cat bus (cars) and also staying on the trains that run through the water.  Once the soot sprite reaches the fire five times, the game levels up and the speed of the obstacles on the canvas increases.  Scores are also collected and appended to the DOM, and a high score is saved in localStorage.  The game has three levels, after which the final win page appears.
